-   Mediation concerns each combination of the original treatment A=0, A=1 with the mediation variable M=0, M=1.

-   Controlling both treatment and mediation variables might feel unnatural:

$CDE(m) = Y | [do(a=1),do(m)] - Y|do[a=0,do(m)]$

-   If that's not weird enough, most M interventions are not well-defined. If Smoking (A) leads to TAR (M) that leads to (Y): How can we manipulate TAR independently? We might think of little people that clean TAR from our lungs (M=0) or adding TAR to our lungs (M=1).

$CDE(m) = Y | [do(a=1),do(m)] - Y|do[a=0,do(m)]$

Mediation put us closer to "How Nature Works". By making our causal paths more explicit, we make our narrative closer to the domain expertise. Smoking makes COPD, is not as clear as Smoking makes COPD by increasing TAR in the lungs.

Pure mediation puts the boundaries around the possible causal paths.

$NDE = Y|[do(M|do(a=0))] - Y|[do(M|do(a=0))] = 0$

-   NDE under Pure mediation also blocks all the harm made by cigarettes by setting the Mediator to the potential outcome that would have been if the patient didn't smoke, while comparing Smoking vs Non-smoking scenario with the manipulated M values.

-   Under pure mediation, once we know the value of the mediator M the original treatment A value does not matter. It might be challenging to think about the Natural Direct Effect, but just keep in mind that once we manipulate the TAR (M) under pure mediation it does not matter if the patient smoked or didn't smoke.

#### 😇 God-Given Counterfactual Data

Let's calculate NIE:

###### Setting do(A=1)
$$Y|[do(M|do(A=1))]$$
- We take the counterfactual M values for A=1

- And the corresponding counterfactual Y values
